## Line Detection
This project aims to implement a navigator module for a robot that moves on specific lines on a path. To implement this module 3 LDR sensor was used to detect the light reflected from the surface and based on the amount of reflection the path can be detected. Also with the help of 3 LDR that placed on a straight line, we can figure out witch way to move the robot in order to keep it on a straight line.

## Mapping environment using SLAM
This project involves the implementation of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) in the Robot Operating System (ROS). We have a pre-existing map, and we've developed a mobile robot equipped with sensors and algorithms to autonomously explore the environment and generate an accurate map using SLAM techniques.

## Obstacle Avoidance using VFH algorithm
This project focuses on implementing obstacle avoidance using the Vector Field Histogram (VFH) algorithm. We aim to develop a robust system that allows a mobile robot to navigate through complex environments, avoiding obstacles effectively by utilizing VFH-based decision-making.

## PID controll mobile robot in ROS for wall following
This project involves the development of a wall-following mobile robot using a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller. The robot is simulated in the ROS (Robot Operating System) environment, utilizing Gazebo and RViz simulators for a comprehensive and realistic simulation.
